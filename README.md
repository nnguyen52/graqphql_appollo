**This will be my most ambitious project <br>
The project will be a replication of Reddit, with basic features (No Machine Learning).**

#### These are technologies im learning and applying:
##### Front End:
* NextJS (SSR + ISG)
* Apollo (handle app's states)
* GraphQL
* MUI (UI)
* Formik (forms)
* RecoilJS (If viable, since states can be handled with apollo cache)
* Cloudinary (for saving images)
* Real time with socketIO (This feature is rather complex, i will try my best!)

##### Back End:
* Node
* Express
* Apollo Server
* GraphQL
* MongoDB
* NodeMailer
* SocketIO
* And other libraries to enhance securities (Argon, https cookie)

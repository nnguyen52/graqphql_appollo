**This will be my most ambitious project <br>
The project will be a replication of Reddit, with basic features (No Machine Learning).**

#### These are technologies im learning and applying:
##### Front End:
* NextJS (SSR + ISG) with Apollo
* Apollo (handle app's states)
* GraphQL
* MUI (UI) + vanilla CSS
* Formik (forms)
* RecoilJS (If viable, since states can be handled with apollo cache)
* Cloudinary (for saving images, videos)
* Framer (for all animations) + Lottie
* Real time with socketIO (This feature is rather complex, i will try my best!)

##### Back End:
* Node
* Express
* Apollo Server
* GraphQL
* MongoDB
* NodeMailer
* SocketIO
* And other libraries to enhance securities (Argon2, https-cookie, JWT if viable) 

#### __NOTE: If you are interested in this project, let me know! (email: coh.jr11@gmail.com)
+ i dont use Redux anymore, since RecoilJS will be an amazing alternative. Im learning GraphQL so applying other state-management libs will defeat the purpose of caching.
